# HARVESTGRID
 Harvestgrid is a web application to solve a common issue in our country. 
When we search about that the Sri Lanka department and the keels are planning to 
launch a launch web site to develop a market and the farmers where the farmers can 
feed their harvest and keels staff can buy them. Any farmer can register to the 
system using their national id number and crop-related details. When the harvest 
picked a farmer can report the details through a web site with supporting photos of 
the crop.
Keels and dos staff can view all reports. They can also evaluate the evidence, 
approve farmers' reports, and send a request to the reported location shown map.
Keels staff can comminute by sending direct messages to the farmers and 
buy farmers products they do can see the report as a different graph such as 
percentages of fruit, Vegetables, successful transaction and wasted harvest this is 
the summary of our website, and I think this very useful for the country.
